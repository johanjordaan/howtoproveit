1. Analyse the logic forms of the following statements:

    1.1  We'll have either a reading assignment or homework problems, but we won't have both homework problems and a test.
    
    ***
    
      Let :
      + $A =$ a reading assignment
      + $B =$ homework problems
      + $C =$ a test
      
      In :
      + We'll have either **a reading assignment** or **homework problems**, but we won't have both **homework problems** and **a test**.
  
  
      Then :
      + We'll have either $A$ or $B$, but we won't have both $A$ and $C$
      + We'll have either $A \vee B$, but we $\neg$ $(A \wedge C)$
      
      And  finally :
      + $(A \vee B) \wedge \neg (A \wedge C)$

    1.2 You won't go skiing, or you will and there won't be any snow

    ***
    
    Let :
    + $A =$ go skiing 
    + $B =$ there will be snow
    
    In :
    + You won't **go skiing**, or you will and there won't **be any snow**    

    Then :
    + You won't $A$, or you will and won't $B$
    + You $\neg A$, or $A$ and $\neg B$
    
    And finally :
    + $\neg A \vee (A \wedge \neg B)$


    ***
    
    1.3 $\sqrt{7} \le 2$.

    ***
    
    Let :
    + $A \le B => A < B \vee A = B$

    Then :
    + $\sqrt{7} \le 2 => \sqrt{7} < 2 \vee \sqrt{7} = 2$
